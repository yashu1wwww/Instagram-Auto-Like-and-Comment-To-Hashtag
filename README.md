Instagram Auto Like and Comment To Hashtag using selenium with python

👉Instagram Auto Like & Comments For A Particular Hashtag

https://youtu.be/-oPVJoCRNI4

Change line 16 and 17 with your username and password respectively. In line 21, replace the "amazing" line with your required hashtag.

I have added functionality for auto-liking and commenting on up to 25 posts with the specified hashtag. If you want to auto-like and comment on another 25 posts, copy lines 35 to 282 and paste them in line 283. You can use Notepad++ to do this.

To get started, download the latest version of Chrome Driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and extract the file. Then, place it in the specified folder. Open cmd in that folder and enter "hlc.py" or double-click on "hlc.py". Alternatively, you can rename the file and run it.

👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then the code never run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.1 or pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"

These Project Is Only For Reference Use Dont Use In large Scale.
